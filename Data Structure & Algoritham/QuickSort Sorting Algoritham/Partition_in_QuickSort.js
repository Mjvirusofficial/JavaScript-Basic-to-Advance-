// To perform quick sort you need to understand about partition
// partition is dividing the element into left to right we also 
// need to know about pivot, it is a index which we declare in program.

// In quick sort we declare pivot as last element where the element before 
// pivot is lesser from pivot and the element before pivot is greater than 
// pivot_________________________________________________________________#

// let's start...!
