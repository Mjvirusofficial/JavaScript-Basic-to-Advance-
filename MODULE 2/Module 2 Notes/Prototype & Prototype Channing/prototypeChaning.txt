2.What is Prototype chaining?
--> Every javascript has a in_buit property that is known as prototype.

--> This prototype is nothing but an object itself,

--> As its an object so, it will contain its own prototype

--> This will create a chain of property inside the another prototype 
    known as prototype channing_________________________________________#

--> This chain will end also when we reach a prototype with null value.

--> Object.getPrototypeOf() method is used to fetch the prototype object.
