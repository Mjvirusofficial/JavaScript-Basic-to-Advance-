#What is Conditional Rendring?
--> Conditional Rendring made from two word first is conditional second is rendring 
    conditional means any condition that have a property that if it is true then 
    perform a task.

--> And second is rendring means displaying the data which comes from any condition.

--> ● It is a concept where elements are displayed on the UI after meeting certain
    conditions.

--> ● It is used to add dynamic behavior to the application and ensure validations
    are properly done.

--> ● E.g. Facebook allows only 13+ aged people to open an account, so if the
    user’s age is 13+, the user account screen will be displayed; else, a warning
    will be displayed.

--> To demonstrate conditional rendering, we will create an HTML file and add a JS
    function there.
    ● The HTML file will have a button with onclick attribute.
    ● The JavaScript function will have conditionally render two different buttons.
