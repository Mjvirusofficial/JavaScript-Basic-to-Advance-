3.Define process & threads?
#Process:-
Process is a whole program you can say, which is excutable.
what is program then program is a set of instruction & you
can say a collection of code______________________________#

&
#Thread:-
Thread is nothing but segment of a process means, its a small part of process
in other word you can say________________________________________________#
Thread is way that tells to the program how to excute in fastly or slowely.

let,s understand single-thread and multi-threads:-
You have a task to iterate a loop 100 tym?
you have 2 option________________________#

#Option 1:
Single-thread that take to take 1sec in one itreration
you know if take 1se to iterate one time then it will 
take 100sec to iterate all.

Option 2:
Multi-threads means you loop iterate 100 time then divide
its on 4 single thread that is called multi-threads
You iterate each loop at 25 time.
1 loop 25 time.
2 loop 25 time.
3 loop 25 time.
4 loop 25 time.
You find the total time in multi-thread in 25 second.

So, Multi-thread is more faster than single thread;
