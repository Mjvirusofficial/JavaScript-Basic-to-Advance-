#What do you mean by Folder Structure?
--> IN simple word folder structure is a way to arrange your folder in best way
    when you work on any project then you saves your project file or folder in 
    your local computer or any cloud so, its important to stored your files on 
    folder in a particular formate because when you and your team see your project 
    next time.

--> And supose you have many folder then that its very complex to find your particular 
    file that's you need to access. So, its important and best practice to store your 
    saves in particular formate. 

--> ● For everybody in the project to understand the purpose of the files there needs
    to be a structure accepted and acknowledged by the project peers.

--> ● Thus we follow certain methods to group these files in folders, so that it
    becomes easier to track and maintain them.

--> ● There is no hard and fast rule on maintaining folder structure. Depending on
    the project, the folder structure keeps changing, but we have certain practises
    that we can follow or draw inspiration from.


#Best Practices.........!
Group the files properly:
--> ● Keep the base folder as “src” or “root”.
--> ● The files that don’t have any dependency on other files should be kept here.
--> ● Keep all JS files in one folder and CSS files in one.
--> ● Keep files pertaining to one feature in one folder.
--> ● E.g. For login page, create a folder called Login and keep the essential files there.

# Avoid Nesting:
● We can flatten the above by removing the unnecessary password folder and adding the three files in one folder, like
this:

#Best Practices:
Avoid creating folders for housing just one file:
● If there is only one file, try to keep it in the root folder or club it with other folders containing multiple files, do
not create a folder to contain just one file or a few files as it makes the folder structure nested and unnecessary
complex.
