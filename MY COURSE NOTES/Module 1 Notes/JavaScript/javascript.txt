--> Javascript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

--> Originally the name of javascript before javascript named was mocha and after that it was changed the name as javascript.

--> You thought one time is java or javascript similar then i told there is no any relationship between them.

--> The main reason of changing the name from mocha or Livescript into Javascript is a marketing technology.

--> Because in that time the java programming was become a most popular language that's why developer wanted to change the name javascript from Mocha or Livescript

--> In 1990s internet widely used by user. More companies introduced own browser that supports different different scripting language.

--> So, that time Netscape decided to make a standard of scripting languages.

--> So, Netscape given own scripting language to ECMA.

--> it's stand for Eroupean, computer, Manufacturing, Association. 

--> Its become a standard for all scripting language means any update will happened then all scripting language supported this feature.

######~Why use Javascript~#######

#Why should we learn javascript? 
Well there are a few reasons for that:- 

1.First reason is that the browser understand only Html, Css and javascript.

But now there are some other language like GWT(Java), dart etc using this we can also create U.I

But those language translate the code into javascript and then javascript code gets excute on the browser.

So, why not we write our code in Javascript itself it is very usefull and also save times that takes to convert any other language into javascript.

And also we have more control over the code.

Another reason is once you learn javascript you become a full stack web developer without need to learn any other language.

Also javascript is used to create Desktop application with Electron and React native desktop frameworks.

And javascript is also used to create Android and iOS application using React native.
