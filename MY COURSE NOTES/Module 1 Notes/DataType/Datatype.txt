####Data Types in javascript####
Data type is a classification of data that tells to the compiler or interpret that how the programmer intend to use the data.

There are basically 5 and 6 types of data types in javascript:- 
1. Integers
2. Strings
3. Boolean
4. Array 
5. Object
6. Null
7. Undefined

Integers:-
Integer is any numric value.

String:- 
String is a collection of alphanumeric, characters and symbols which stored the different types of word and sentence.

Boolean can be 2 values either true or false. 
Whenever we want to store a value whose value can be either true or false, we can use Boolean datatype to store it.

Number:- 
Numbers are collection of different digits. They can be integers or decimal numbers. 

There are different types of numbers like integers, decimal numbers, exponential numbers, special numbers like Infinity, NaN and so on.
Example – 
1. var num = 123; //Integer
2. var num = 212.13456

console.log(num.toExponential(4)); toExponential function is used to write exponential 
numbers.

Output -> 2.13e+0
We can directly write numbers in exponential form too. For example 
var num = 2.13e+10;
