4.What is Synchronous and Asynchronous?
#Synchronous:-
Synchronous is process that excute your instruction one by one
Which means supose you have 4 instruction________________________#

instruction 1
instruction 2
instruction 3
instruction 4

@fter compelete your first instruction the move on next instruction.

#Asynchronous:-
Asynchronous is also a process but its not excute your instruction
one by one its, excute your all instructoin at time.
Which means supose you have 4 instruction__________#

instruction 1
instruction 2
instruction 3
instruction 4
 
Compelete your all instruction at a time.


We have two Asynchronous funtion in javascript
1.SetTimeout
2.Setinterval

#SetTimeout:-
Its allows to run a function some interval of time.
means, its delay the excution time________________#

Syntax:- setTimeout(functon || your code..., delayTime,arg1,arg2)

function add(n1,n2){
  console.log(`Addition of ${n1} and ${n2} is:- ${n1+n2}`)
}
add(2,4)

setTimeout(add,2000,5,5)

#SetInterval:-
Its allows to run a function repeatedly, starting after the 
specified interval of time then repeat continously 
at that interval_________________________________#

Syntax:- setInterval(functon || your code..., delayTime,arg1,arg2)

function add(n1,n2){
    console.log(`Addition of ${n1} and ${n2} is:- ${n1+n2}`)
}
  
setInterval(add,1000,5,5)
 
#ClearInterval:- 
It is the method used to stop/clear the interval.

● It accepts the variable more precisely intervalID to which we assign the 
setInterval(). Here we use clearInterval(getFood) with getFood variable to stop the 
setInterval().

● It does not clear the delay in the setInterval. It actually stops the setInterval() event 
itself before execution.

function add(n1,n2){
    console.log(`Addition of ${n1} and ${n2} is:- ${n1+n2}`)
}

let clear = setInterval(add,1000,5,5)
clearInterval(clear)
